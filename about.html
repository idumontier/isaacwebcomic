    <h2>Isaac DuMontier</h2>
    <p>Hey, I decided to make a short fun webcomic! The inspiration was based on my love for the outdoors and comedy. I wanted to try a few different art styles for my characters and keep the panels interesting. My artistic ability isn't the best, but I attempted to apply various techniques we learned throughout the semester. To me, making a story about polar opposite people just made sense to display various comic techniques.</p>
  <p>I took the class as I grew up reading and collecting comic books! So naturally, spending the semester studying one of my favorite childhood hobbies only made sense.<p>
    <p> Thanks for taking the time to click through my page!
